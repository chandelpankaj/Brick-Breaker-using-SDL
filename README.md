# Brick Breaker
This game will remind you of the classic arcade games of your past. Your objective is to break all the colored bricks on each level. Move the paddle side to side using the mouse or arrow keys and use space to fire the laser when you have the power.

This game features 14 different types of powers, to increase ball size, multiple balls, fire ball, sticky paddle, big paddle, small paddle, fast ball etc. Some powers will make it easy for you to clear the level while some will make it harder for you.

On the home page, you can turn on/off the background music, resume/start the game.

On collecting power, the ball/paddle's behaviour may change, like fireball can go through bricks, fireball won't be reflected by the normal bricks.
